# Stripe India Regulations Solution

## Problem
You're encountering the error: "As per Indian regulations, only registered Indian businesses (i.e. sole proprietorships, limited liability partnerships and companies, but not individuals) can accept international payments."

## Root Cause
Stripe has specific requirements for Indian businesses to accept international payments:
- Only registered business entities can accept international payments
- Individual accounts cannot process international payments
- This is a regulatory requirement from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Domestic Payment Methods Configuration
Updated the payment controller to use domestic Indian payment methods when the currency is INR:
- **UPI**: Unified Payments Interface
- **Net Banking**: Direct bank transfers
- **Cards**: Credit/Debit cards

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
Added specific error handling for Indian payment regulation errors with user-friendly messages.

### 3. Automatic Tax Calculation
Enabled automatic tax calculation for Indian transactions to comply with GST requirements.

## Additional Solutions (Choose Based on Your Needs)

### Option A: Use Only Domestic Payments (Recommended for Individual Accounts)
If you're an individual creator:
1. Set your currency to INR in environment variables
2. Use only domestic payment methods (UPI, Net Banking, Cards)
3. This avoids international payment restrictions

### Option B: Register as a Business Entity
If you need to accept international payments:
1. **Sole Proprietorship**: Register with local authorities
2. **LLP (Limited Liability Partnership)**: Register with MCA
3. **Private Limited Company**: Register with MCA
4. Update your Stripe account with business details
5. Provide required business documentation

### Option C: Use Alternative Payment Gateways
Consider these alternatives that may have different requirements:
- **Razorpay**: Good for Indian businesses
- **PayU**: Popular in India
- **Instamojo**: Simple setup for individuals

## Environment Configuration

Make sure your environment variables are set correctly:

```env
# For domestic payments only
CURRENCY=INR
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... # Your Stripe secret key

# For international payments (requires business account)
CURRENCY=USD
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... # Your Stripe secret key
```

## Testing the Solution

1. **Test with INR currency**: Should work with domestic payment methods
2. **Test with USD currency**: May still show the error if using individual account
3. **Check payment methods**: Verify UPI, Net Banking options appear for INR

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: The code changes should resolve the issue for domestic payments
2. **Short-term**: Test the payment flow with INR currency
3. **Long-term**: Consider business registration if international payments are needed
